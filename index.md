#Overview

_Project phase: Inception_

A customizable calendar for RPG/fantasy planning.

## Project Statement

The calendar shall display the day number and any events the user has set for that day.
Events shall have options including the day number it starts on, how often it repeats (with an option to not repeat), and if its state is persistent.
For example, consider the following example events:
* On day #37, a herd of Centaurs rides by the town of Emon
* Once per year (every 365 days) the town of Redmont has a harvest festival
* Day of the week labels: e.g. Day #1=Sunday, Day #2=Monday, ..., Day #7=Saturday, Day #8=Sunday, ...
* The location of a character: e.g. Robb is "Waging War" day #123 until day #234 whereupon he is "at The Twins" until day #238 whereupon his status ends
